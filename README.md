# JuniorFrontendTest

1. App is fully working and fetching data from github.
2. User can click repository that will navigate him to actual Git repository
3. When sending first request getting error message on fronted even request is not failed and I get data afterAll( still investigating).
4. Added Unit testing even when there is not much to test because of encapsulated code, and most of app is manipulating DOM

STRUCTURE OF APP

App is devided into 3 controlls - 1. UI Controll - Only for manipulating DOM
                                  2. Data Controll - Only for working with data that are sent from API call
                                  3. General Controll - Used for init off app and Event listeners, this controll is reponsible
                                                        for working with UI and Data Controll.  
                                                        
In this App is used plain javascript, no libaries and frameworks except UnitTesting.
